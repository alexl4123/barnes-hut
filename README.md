# barnes-hut
Implementation of the barnes-hut algorithm

This implementation was part of a group project I did in university in my second semester (Summer term 2020).

One needs to import the project into one's favorite ide (preferably intellij, as there it is specified as a project).

Then one can run the simulation by executing the ''Simulation'' class (/src/mi17bta10/simulation/Simulation.java).

There one can specify which simulation shall be run, 5 different types can be chosen (see /src/mi17bta10/generateSimulationData/SimulationType.java).
